# gem-dash-game  
This repository contains the source code and assets for Group Ci's PPM project: the Gem Dash game.  
The Practical Project Management module was taken in our second year and required us to work as a group to create a project.  
We chose to create a procedurally generated 2D side scroller, titled Gem Dash.
